## Description

For the purpose of the test I used the most up-to-date version available of the frameworks that I chose: Angular version 12.x.x and Angular Material 12.x.x. I chose Angular Material because it offers a high level API test.
This component makes tests easier to read, more robust and less likely to break when updating the framework. For the responsive design instead I used Angular flex 9.x.x that provides a sophisticated layout API using Flexbox CSS + mediaQuery. On top, it has a responsive engine.

I implemented unit tests for a total coverage of 90% (more or less XD) of the code.
